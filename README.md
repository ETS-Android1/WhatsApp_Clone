## WhatsApp Clone Android

A WhatsApp like chat application for Android with various WhatsApp features
such as sending texts messages. 

## About the application

The application heavily relies on
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for it's seamless integration
with android, fast development and free usage. Most of it's products
like [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth),
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore),
[Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/products/storage) and
[Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions) make
it very easy to mimic WhatsApp's features without so much hassle.

### How to use/test the application

Since the application relies on
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), we need to add it to our app
and also create a new project on the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).



##### Sending Messages
Messages stored in Realime Database in chat section with UId
